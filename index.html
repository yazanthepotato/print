<h1>My trip in turkey!<h1>
  <font size="+1">
My story in istambul and antalya turkey. My father was preparing bags with me and my siblings shirts and pants. I asked if we are gonna travel and my dad kept saying no. Finally I aksed my grandmother and she said that we were traveling to a secret place, "a suprise". I thought that I was gonna go to italy because I always told my father I want to go to italy. At the time my mom came from kuwait to visit us because my parents were divorced anf I lived with my father. We only got to spend two days with her. My mother kept telling me that i am going to travel with my stepmother but I kept refusinf because I knew that she left use 1 year ago. We found her in the airport with us, How did my mother know about my stepmother, since when did my mom like my stepmother? I asked my self. I felt stupid for not beliving my mother. Finally I reached the airport and got to the check in, guess what, my passport was expired. luckely I am old enough to travel by card. I finally reached istambul, turkey at midnight. I went to the hotel and slept. The next day i was watching people walking through the street and a guy wearing a bare costume or rabbit, it was hard to tell. We explored the area and then we went shopping in a very nice place, it was a small road made with bricks, on the side there were buildings and shops, also starbucks. We went to a resturant which had "kunafah" a national sweet for some former ottoman countries. The "kunafah" had ice cream on top which tasted nice. After that we where in a taxi and we passed by a building which had my name on it, it was large. It turned out my name in turkish "yazan" means "in summer". We went into a place which had statues of celbrities and also old geniuses like albert einstein, also albert einstein was there. We went to a place which had the entire istambul made out of lego, it was huge. Me and my brother found lego boats which were remote controlled, we played none-stop until we had to go.

<h1>In antalya</h1>

 <font size="+3">
   so now we cam to antalya it was really hot there, it felt like I was going to melt. My father took us into this huge hotel which had a swimming pool as large as my house. it had small houses which had one floor, it was a square house. You needed a key to enter. We enterd while my father and stepmother were going around to explore the place, mw and my brother wtness a spider. When our parents finally came we told them all about what we saw. They said they will try to find it and kill the next day. They didn't find it but I didn't care because I was enjoing the place. The place was clean, it smelled good, they had a free ice cream stand. and two huge poools with slids. The pools are filled with people, turkish people. I also met a british guy there but I didn't get any of thier contact information. and finally time to go back to istambul.

<h1>Back in isambul</h1>

<font size="+3">yes finally I am back in istambul. This time we went to a palace that belonged to an ottoman leader. Beside there was a mosque, I asked my dad if we can pray in that mosque, he said ok but we had to leave before prayer time. The mosque belonged to one of the ottoman leaders. I went to kidzania where the only thing I did is play the flight simulator, I always mistake the throttle with the joy stick, I don't anymore. The final three days we just went shoping. We went to a mall where they had a lego store and inside there is a small "lego museum" I asume. I got a lego space ship that I can distroy and 
change it into a car or a space station. </font>


<font size="+3"> My story’s purpose is to entertain people, and to make them also curious. 
I talked about eating kunafa with ice cream in turkey, it was nice. They put the ice cream on top of the kunafah and pour chocolate on the ice cream. I also went to a palace which belongs to the ottomans. Beside it was a very precious mosque, the mosque looks really clean, the marbles on the mosque are shiny. 
When I went into the palace it was large and had a lot of people visiting it. I was wondering who would live in a palace that big?. How could he navigate from the front door to his room?. As I walked in the palace I saw very old shoes, old maps, and old badges. 


I try to clearly describe the places I've been to. I try to make the story a little bit funny just so people get entertained. It’s a travel writing story, it is supposed to have real information about a place you traveled to. It's also fun to read about travel writing because you can learn about new places and their history.  For example I can learn about Germany in World War 2 from a book where someone goes to Germany during World War 2. For example someone wrote about visiting Belgium before World War 1 started, and left after World War 1. Travel writing can also help with writing your own travel story, you can learn how to organize your writing when you read books about travel writing.</font>
